# Intro
This is an experiment project to learn how different third-party APIs can be implemented within my own project. My goal with this project to get familiar with LLMs, and creating an application on my own which is able to use third-party LLMs, OCRs and other modern solutions.

# CompareDocs main goal:
Reading and comparing documents using AI. Useful for time consuming and repetitive task like invoice comparison etc.
