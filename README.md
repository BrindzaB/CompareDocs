# Intro
This is an experiment project to learn how different third-party APIs can be implemented within my own project. My goal with this project to get familiar with LLMs, and creating an application on my own which is able to use third-party LLMs, OCRs and other modern solutions.

# CompareDocs main goal:
Parsing, recognizing and comparing documents using AI. Useful for repetitive and time-consuming invoice comparison tasks.

# Warning
Since the application is using OpenAI LLM, you will need a valid API key to be able to use the app.
